In this project the code calculates eigenvalues using the normalized power 
iteration algorithm with deflation to find two eigenvalues and corresponding
eigenvector for the dominant eigenvalue of a given matrix A, where A is 
a square matrix.

The code is completed as desired and ready for compilation.

This program needs 3 command line arguments for parameters. Create an input 
text file and write down a square matrix into it. Then, open an empty output
text file.All the documents must be in the same folder that you will call 
from cmd.

Open the source.cpp, compile and run it. It will be written on the screen 
how to run from cmd. You need to write 3 command line arguments. First one 
is the name of the input file with extension (i.e. input.txt), second one 
is the tolerance in float (i.e. 1E-6), and thiird one is the name of the 
output file with extension (i.e. output.txt). As a result you should write :

		 " source.exe input.txt 1E-6 output.txt "

You need to write the directory of these files in cmd.
(i.e. C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\source.exe input.txt 1E-6 output.txt)

The program will indicate problems if there is.
If there are more or less than 3 argument or any file can not be opened
the program will indicate.
