Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting

In this project you have to create an "A.txt" and "b.txt" file
and write the variables in that text files. Then compile the code.
"A.txt" and "b.txt" file must be in the same location in your computer.
The "A.txt" file must be a square matrix and the "b.txt" matrix must have
the same row number with "A.txt".
The program creates the "x.txt" file and find the x values and write the values 
in the file.It uses Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting.
If your matrix is singular the program will warn you and write "it is singular."
The machine precision for this program is designed for 1E-6.

A:
1.000 1.000
1.000 1.001
b1:		b2:
2.000		2.000
2.000		2.001


If the matrix is 2x2 it calculates the condition numbers at 1 and infinity.
If it has high condition numbers it is called ill-conditioned. It will cauese
some problems.
